# Retrospective
I like the multithreading, it is very easy to kick off if you are smart about it.
Errors as return types rather than Exceptions coming up from somewhere are a plus.
Visibility by function/method name capitalization is terrible.

Done diferently, I would have made each day its own `interface` to avoid weird naming as the days progressed
(maybe a refactor should be in the works).
